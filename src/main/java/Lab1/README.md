# Lab1: Comp3111 - Software Engineering

This is my 1st lab in Comp3111 - Software Engineering
1. I have learned the way to build a Java Project in IntelliJ.
2. I have successfully created my first GitHub repository to share the project source with others.

Here's the screenshot of my 1st lab project in IntelliJ:
